# Project_Develop_Assign_3

This project is liscensed by the MIT License because it is very flexible. It means that anyone can use my project for pretty much anything they want. They can change it, share it, but with permission. The only thing they have to do is to include my original copyright notice and disclaimer, which basically means giving me credit for my work and letting others know that I am not responsible if anything goes wrong.
